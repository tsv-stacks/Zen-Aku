    <h3>The story of Zen-Aku and Merrick</h3>
<p>Our story begins after the defeat of Animus at the hands of Master Org. Merrick decided that his only hope of stopping him was a legend about a cursed mask that could bestow great power upon the wearer. He found the mask of Zen-Aku and put it on and gained its powers, using the Predazord to destroy Master Org, but immediately afterwards, the wolf mask seized control of his mind, merging him with and transforming him into <strong>Zen-Aku.</strong> </p>
<p>3000 years later, Zen-Aku was released by Nayzor to destroy the present day Wild Force Power Rangers. He possessed no memory of his past, only that he wanted to destroy the
rangers in vengeance for their predecessors sealing him. Zen-Aku proved able to fight the rangers quite well, even using his own Wildzords, and succeeded in stealing the Elephant, Giraffe, Black Bear, and Polar Bear Animal Crystals and adding them to his collection of Dark Wildzords.</p>
<p>
  Princess Shayla had begun to piece together the truth and later, Animus managed to cause a lunar eclipse that allowed Merrick to take back control. He told the rangers' what had happened to him, but then the eclipse ended, changing him back into Zen-Aku. Shayla managed to piece everything together and realized that the curse came from the Predazord, because after Master Org's defeat, the wolf mask had made the Wolf, Hammerhead, and Alligator Wildzord's evil and their guardian along with them. Shayla then told the rangers that the only way to free Merrick was to defeat the Predazord, which they succeeded in doing with help from the new Armadillo and Rhino Wildzords.</p>
